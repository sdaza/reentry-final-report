  abstract = {Social rehabilitation (SR) of people who break the law is the key objective of intervention programs in Chilean jails. The goal of this research was to elicit the meaning that prison officers attach to social rehabilitation and their implications for relational practices. We conducted semi-structured interviews to fifteen officers: uniformed staff, professional staff, chaplains and instructors. The full texts of the interviews were analyzed in terms of contents and topic. Results were organized around four categories: political-institutional; subjective-formative; inter-jail; and significance to the inmate. The first conceives SR as an institutional goal related to its value-based mandate. In the second category, SR anchors on the acquisition of technical skills and on personal experience. The third category sees it as a way to regulate different types of intra-jail dynamics. In the last category, SR centers on the inmate, including his/her personal dimension, family and community. These forms of understanding the concept make a contribution to establish the social practices that generate inside jails.},

Previous studies have examined various determinants of extracurricular participation, but mostly focused on social class, demographics, and school characteristics. In this paper we renew the Coleman tradition by putting social capital (as measured by family structure and neighborhood cohesion) in the spotlight and studying the effect of social capital on youth participation in organized extracurricular activities. By using longitudinal data from the 2004 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation of representative households in the U.S. and conducting various robust statistical analyses, we provide updated results on the subject. We find that a two-parent household (especially in relative to households with cohabiting parents) and neighborhood cohesion (i.e., a set of cohesive relationships among parents in the neighborhood) both have a positive and significant association with extracurricular participation. We also find such associations vary somewhat by child's sex, age, race, and the type of extracurricular activity. We conclude that to equalize children's participation in extracurricular activities future social policies should consider interventions that target low-income families and families with singleparent or cohabiting parents, that can improve neighborhood cohesion, and that are tailored by the type of extracurricular activity.},

I estimate the effects of incarceration on transitions into and out of cohabitation and marriage while controlling for other salient life events (e.g., employment, parenthood). Findings indicate that incarceration precipitates an immediate and persistent disruption in residential partnerships and is also a long-term impediment to the transition to marriage (but not the transition to cohabitation). The long-term disruption in existing residential partnerships applies equally to females and males, as well as to whites, African Americans (males only), and Hispanics.},

In the current study, we investigate the role of work quality, measured objectively (hours, income) as well as subjectively (commitment). A routine activities perspective is proposed for the work\textendash crime relationship, and it inspires hypotheses about the way that work reduces crime indirectly, in part, through unstructured leisure and substance-using behaviors that tend to carry situational inducements to offend. The results derive from within-person analyses of monthly data provided by adult male offenders recently admitted to state prison in the Second Nebraska Inmate Study (N = 717; NT = 21,965). The findings indicate that employment significantly reduces self-report crime but only when employed men report strong commitment to their jobs, whereas other work characteristics are unrelated to crime. This indicates that, among serious criminally involved men, the subjective experience of work takes priority over its objective characteristics. The results also indicate that routine activities only partly mediate the relationship among work, job commitment, and crime, whereas the majority of the work\textendash crime relationship remains unmediated.},

Using data from the Florida Department of Corrections, the authors tested hypotheses about the effects of visitation on recidivism. The measures of visitation included whether any visits occurred, the frequency and recency of visitation, and the type of vis-itor received (e.g., family member, friend). The authors also examined whether visitation effects varied by age, sex, race, type of instant offense, and prior incar-ceration. The findings indicate that visitation reduces and delays recidivism.

This review provides estimates for the prevalence of severe mental illness and substance use disorders in incarcerated individuals in LMICs. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 17 electronic databases to identify prevalence studies of psychiatric disorders in prison populations in LMICs, published between January, 1987, and May, 2018. We included representative studies from general prison samples, providing information about four major psychiatric diagnoses: psychosis, major depression, alcohol use disorders, and drug use disorders. We pooled data from studies using random-effects meta-analyses and assessed the sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression. We extracted general population estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases 2016 database to calculate comparative prevalence ratios. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015020905. Findings We identified 23 publications reporting prevalence estimates of severe mental illness and substance use disorders for 14\hphantom{,}527 prisoners from 13 LMICs. In this population, the estimated pooled 1 year prevalence rates for psychosis were 6{$\cdot$}2\% (95\% CI 4{$\cdot$}0\textendash 8{$\cdot$}6), 16{$\cdot$}0\% (11{$\cdot$}7\textendash 20{$\cdot$}8) for major depression, 3{$\cdot$}8\% (1{$\cdot$}2\textendash 7{$\cdot$}6) for alcohol use disorders, and 5{$\cdot$}1\% (2{$\cdot$}9\textendash 7{$\cdot$}8) for drug use disorders. We noted increased prevalence at prison intake and geographic variations for substance use disorders. For alcohol use disorders, prevalence was higher in the southeast Asian region than in the eastern Mediterranean region; and drug use disorders were more prevalent in the eastern Mediterranean region than in Europe. Prevalence ratios indicated substantially higher rates of severe mental illness and substance use disorders among prisoners than in the general population (the prevalence of non-affective psychosis was on average 16 times higher, major depression and illicit drug use disorder prevalence were both six times higher, and prevalence of alcohol use disorders was double that of the general population). Interpretation The prevalence of major psychiatric disorders is high in prisoners in LMIC compared with general populations. As these findings are likely to reflect unmet needs, the development of scalable interventions should be a public health priority in resource-poor settings.

However, white women, women who had served longer sentences, women who had not lived with their children prior to incarceration, and women who did not approve of their children's custody arrangements were found to have significantly higher levels of role strain.

  abstract = {Understanding whether, and in what situations, time spent in prison is criminogenic or preventive has proven challenging due to data availability and correlated unobservables. This paper overcomes these challenges in the context of Norway's criminal justice system, offering new insights into how incarceration affects subsequent crime and employment. We construct a panel dataset containing the criminal behavior and labor market outcomes of the entire population, and exploit the random assignment of criminal cases to judges who differ systematically in their stringency in sentencing defendants to prison. Using judge stringency as an instrumental variable, we find that imprisonment discourages further criminal behavior, and that the reduction extends beyond incapacitation. Incarceration decreases the probability an individual will reoffend within 5 years by 29 percentage points, and reduces the number of offenses over this same period by 11 criminal charges. In comparison, OLS shows positive associations between incarceration and subsequent criminal behavior. This sharp contrast suggests the high rates of recidivism among ex-convicts is due to selection, and not a consequence of the experience of being in prison. Exploring factors that may explain the preventive effect of incarceration, we find the decline in crime is driven by individuals who were not working prior to incarceration. Among these individuals, imprisonment increases participation in programs directed at improving employability and reducing recidivism, and ultimately, raises employment and earnings while discouraging further criminal behavior. For previously employed individuals, while there is no effect on recidivism, there is a lasting negative effect on employment. Contrary to the widely embraced `nothing works' doctrine, these findings demonstrate that time spent in prison with a focus on rehabilitation can indeed be preventive for a large segment of the criminal population.},

While the maternal role may constitute a conventional identity ``script'' for these ex-inmates and motivate their success on parole, the challenges they face that impact their childrearing before prison make reassuming their maternal roles a precarious enterprise.

  abstract = {Objectives: While the economic model of crime suggests that improving post-prison labor market prospects should reduce recidivism, evaluations of previous employment-oriented re-entry programs have mixed results, possibly due to the multi-faceted challenges facing prisoners at the time of their release. We present an evaluation of an experiment that combines enhanced employment opportunities with wrap around services before and after release. Methods: This paper presents what we believe is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a re-entry program that combines post-release subsidized work with ``reach-in'' social services provided prior to release. The sample was 236 high-risk offenders in Milwaukee with a history of violence or gang involvement. Results: We observe increased employment rates and earnings during the period when ex-offenders are eligible for subsidized jobs, and these gains persist throughout the year. The intervention has significant effects (p {$<$} 0.01) in reducing the likelihood of rearrest. The likelihood that the treatment group is re-imprisoned during the first year after release is lower than for controls (22 vs. 26 {{\%}}) but the difference is not statistically significantly different from zero. Conclusions: The results of our RCT suggest that ``reach-in'' services to help improve human capital of inmates prior to release, together with wrap around services following release, boosts employment and earnings, although whether there is sufficient impact on recidivism for the intervention to pass a benefit-cost test is more uncertain. Average earnings for both treatment and control groups were very low; legal work simply does not seem that important in the economic lives of released prisoners.},

It begins by reporting data that illustrate that the women report an acutely more painful experience than their male counterparts. It then focuses on the issues that were of particular salience to the women: loss of contact with family members; power, autonomy and control; psychological well-being and mental health; and matters of trust, privacy and intimacy.

If it is true, as is commonly assumed, that women are sentenced more leniently than men, does this tendency vary by class and race? In this book Kathleen Daly explores these issues by analyzing women's and men's cases that are routinely processed in felony courts - cases of homicide, aggravated assault, robbery, larceny, and drug offenses. Daly first presents a statistical analysis of sentencing disparity for a wide sample of cases. Then, from within this sample, she compares forty matched pairs of women and men accused and convicted of statutorily similar offenses, examining in each case the presentence investigation reports and transcripts of the remarks made in court on the day of sentencing. From these documents, Daly constructs a portrait of each defendant and a narrative for each crime, and she identifies the theory of punishment the judge used to justify the sentence imposed. She analyzes whether men and women are pulled into crime in different ways, whether their offenses are comparably serious, and whether court officials use different conceptions of justice in sentencing men and women. By providing both numerical and narrative descriptions of crime and punishment, Daly shows the inadequacies of quantitative analysis: although her statistics, like those of other studies, suggest that women are favored, her close comparison of the matched pairs indicates that gender differences are negligible when the details of the cases are taken into consideration.

Women in jails had high rates of mental health disorders, with a majority meeting lifetime diagnostic criteria for a serious mental illness (50\%), posttraumatic stress disorder (51\%), and/or substance use disorder (85\%). Cox regression analyses were utilized to examine associations between life experiences and risk of engaging in specific criminalized behaviors. Serious mental illness was associated with substance use, running away as a teen, and drug offending. Substance use disorder was related to earlier onset of substance use and driving under the influence. Intimate partner violence increased women's risks for property crimes, drug offending, and commercial sex work. Witnessing violence increased risks for property crimes, fighting, and use of weapons. Experiences of caregiver violence increased the risk of running away as a teen. Qualitative narratives were reviewed to provide insight into connections between women's experiences and onset of criminal behavior.

In an effort to reduce recidivism, MCORP attempted to increase offender access to community services and programming by producing greater case management collaboration between caseworkers in prison and supervision agents in the community. The results showed that MCORP significantly improved employment rates, decreased homelessness, broadened offenders' systems of social support, and increased the extent to which offenders participated in community support programming (mentoring, restorative justice services, and faith-based programming). The findings further revealed that MCORP significantly reduced all three types of reoffending (rearrest, reconviction, and new offense reincarcerations) but did not have a significant impact on supervision revocations for technical violations. The evidence suggests that MCORP was effective in decreasing reoffending largely because it increased the extent to which offenders were employed, involved in community support programming, and able to develop systems of social support. \textcopyright{} 2012 Copyright Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.},

Observable selection bias was minimized by using propensity score match-ing to create a comparison group of 232 nonparticipants who were not significantly different from the 232 EMPLOY offenders. Results from the Cox regression analyses revealed that participating in EMPLOY reduced the hazard ratio for recidivism by 32{{\%}} to 63{{\%}}. The findings further showed that EMPLOY increased the odds of gaining postrelease employment by 72{{\%}}. Although EMPLOY did not have a significant impact on hourly wage, the overall postrelease wages for program participants were significantly higher because they worked a greater number of hours.

This is a critical issue: at a time when there appears to be unprecedented support for expanding rehabilitative programs for offenders, there is a dearth of rigorously vetted program options from which to choose. Methods: Collaborating with a nationally known employment-focused reentry program in Southern California, the authors compared employment, housing, and recidivism outcomes of reentering offenders (n = 217) who were either randomized into the program or simply provided with a list of community resources. This approach was possible because the number of applicants at the time exceeded program capacity. Outcomes were based on self-report interviews conducted 1-year post-randomization and arrest records reflecting a 2-year follow-up period. The follow-up rate for interviews was 87 {{\%}}. Results: No significant differences were found for any of the between-group comparisons on any of the major intervention outcomes. Conclusions: Findings from the study suggest a greater need to apply randomized designs to more carefully evaluate current reentry efforts. Methodological challenges of field experiments are also discussed.},

METHODS: The authors collected self-reported data from recently incarcerated women at a county jail, focusing on prevalence of high-risk health behaviors, history of health care use, history of physical and sexual abuse, and health care coverage. The authors assessed factors associated with poor self-reported health using logistic regression techniques. RESULTS: More than half of the participants reported a history of intravenous drug use, 67\% reported a history of sexual abuse, 79\% reported a history of physical abuse, and 43\% stated that they had a history of trading sex for money or drugs. Two factors were associated with poor self-reported health: history of physical assault (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 5.2) and use of heroin during the month prior to arrest (OR = 2.9; 95\% CI 1.3, 6.6). CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of health risk behaviors among the inmates suggests a number of areas for intervention. These findings may also be used to guide topics addressed during intake interviews of new inmates, and to help identify inmates that require additional medical or social services.},

This article examines the consequences of this mobility for wage inequalities between and among men and women. Using multilevel modeling and data from the 1979 to 2002 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), I disentangle the various ways in which mobility shapes the trajectories of wage growth. Findings caution against accepting the adequacy of prevalent economic models of mobility-models that tend to isolate individual workers' moves from broader patterns of work history and that treat mobility as a decontextualized individual choice. Although workers who frequently switch employers generally end up earning less than their more-stable counterparts, the type, timing, and relative level of changes strongly affect the ultimate wage differential. Differences in the degree of men's and women's labor-force attachment and family circumstances are also influential. Workers who are less attached to the labor force benefit less from changing employers, and women who are married or have children also tend to experience less-favorable mobility-wage outcomes.},

Across the study sample of industrialized countries, results of difference-in-difference propensity score matching show post-unemployment earnings losses to be largely permanent and particularly significant for high-wage and older workers as well as for women. The analyses also show that negative effects of unemployment on workers' subsequent earnings are mitigated through either generous unemployment benefit systems or strict labor market regulation. These effects stem partly from favorable behavioral responses that prevent downward occupational and industrial mobility and partly from changes in the overall structure of labor markets favoring the transferability of worker skills between jobs. These positive effects materialize despite the fact that labor market policies tend to successfully protect the core work force from experiencing a job loss in the first place.},

Housing has long been recognized as a prerequisite for stable employment, access to social services, and other aspects of individual and family functioning. The formerly incarcerated face several administrative and de facto restrictions on their housing options; however, little is known about the unique instabilities that they face. We use a longitudinal survey of urban families to examine housing insecurity among nearly 3000 urban men, including over 1000 with incarceration histories. We find that men recently incarcerated face greater housing insecurity, including both serious hardships such as homelessness, and precursors to homelessness such as residential turnover and relying on others for housing expenses. Their increased risk is tied both to diminished annual earnings and other factors, including, potentially, evictions from public housing supported by Federal ``one-strike'' policies.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Parenthood may play a pivotal role in the criminal desistance process, but few studies have examined the conditions under which becoming a mother or father is most likely to lead to reductions in criminal behavior. Methods: The current longitudinal study draws on four waves of adolescent and young adult interview data (N = 1,066) and HLM regression models to examine the impact of parenthood on criminal trajectories, as well as the degree to which the prosocial potential of parenthood is modified by socioeconomic factors, the nature of the relationship between the biological parents, and pregnancy wantedness. The analysis also draws on narrative life history accounts elicited from a subset of these respondents (N = 22). Results: SES and the wantedness of the pregnancy condition the relationship between parenthood and criminal involvement, however some gender differences emerged. Status of the relationship (married or cohabiting and single) was in general not a strong predictor. Conclusions: Highly disadvantaged young men and women are not as likely as more advantaged young adults to evidence lower levels of criminal behavior after becoming parents, however wanted pregnancies may reduce female involvement in crime regardless of socioeconomic status. In-depth qualitative data further elucidate the conditional nature of the parenthood-crime relationship.},

  abstract = {Retrospective reports in survey interviews and questionnaires are subject to many types of recall error, which affect completeness, consistency, and dating accuracy. Concerns about this problem have led to the development of so-called calendar instruments, or timeline techniques. These aided recall procedures have been designed to help respondents gain better access to long-term memory by providing a graphical time frame in which life history information can be represented. In order to obtain more insights into the potential benefits of calendar methodology, this paper presents a review of the application of calendar instruments, their design characteristics and effects on data quality. Calendar techniques are currently used in a variety of fields, including life course research, epidemiology and family planning studies. Despite the growing interest in these new methods, their application often lacks sufficient theoretical foundation and little attention has been paid to their effectiveness. Several recent studies however, have demonstrated that in comparison to more traditional survey methods, calendar techniques can improve some aspects of data quality. While calendar instruments have been shown to be potentially beneficial to retrospective data quality, there is an apparent need for methodological research that generates more systematic knowledge about their application in social surveys.},

This study examines motivation to participate in aftercare among women offenders and whether their participation in both in-custody and aftercare treatment reduces their risk of recidivism. Surveys were conducted with women (N = 1,158) in prison-based substance abuse treatment programs. Return-to-prison was examined among participants in community-based aftercare (N = 1,182) over 12 months following treatment discharge. Higher treatment motivation was associated with child welfare involvement, prior treatment, and use of ``harder'' drugs; ethnic minority women had lower treatment motivation compared with White women. Participants who completed the aftercare program, or who had longer treatment duration, and those who had participated in an in-prison program prior to parole had reduced risk of recidivism. Study findings suggest the value of community aftercare for women offenders, particularly when combined with prior in-prison treatment.}

Drawing on a unique dataset that uses administrative records to follow a cohort of Michigan parolees released in 2003 over time, we examine returns to pre-prison environments, both immediately after prison and in the months and years after release. We then investigate the role of intermediate sanctions in residential mobility among parolees. Our results show low rates of return to former neighborhoods and high rates of residential mobility after prison, a significant portion of which is driven by intermediate sanctions resulting from criminal justice system supervision. These results suggest that, through parole supervision, the criminal justice system generates significant residential mobility.},

Findings reveal considerable struggle among our subjects to meet even minimal needs for shelter and food, although economic security and stability could be attained when employment or public benefits were coupled with familial social support. Sustained economic security was rarely achieved absent either strong social support or access to long-term public benefits. However, a select few were able to leverage material support and social networks into trajectories of upward mobility and economic independence. Policy implications are discussed.},

The most widespread effect of imprisonment on employment occurs through incapacitation in prison, both for the initial prison sentence and through the heightened risk of subsequent imprisonment. Negative postrelease effects of imprisonment on employment, employment stability, and employment outside the secondary labor market are concentrated among whites with a presentence work history.

We identify risk factors for housing insecurity, including mental illness, substance use, prior incarceration, and homelessness, as well as protective ``buffers'' against insecurity and homelessness, including earnings and social supports.},

A sample of 427 adult prisoners was assessed at admission to the penal justice system in the metropolitan region of Santiago de Chile using the SCL-90-R and the mini international neuropsychiatric interview. We tested internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha. We examined construct validity using Principial Components Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (PCA and CFA) as well as Mokken Scale Analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to examine external criterion validity against diagnoses established using structured clinical interviews. The SCL-90-R showed good internal consistency for all subscales ({$\alpha$}=0.76\textendash 0.89) and excellent consistency for the global scale ({$\alpha$}=0.97). PCA yielded a 1-factor structure, which accounted for 70.7\% of the total variance. CFA and MSA confirmed the unidimensional structure. ROC analysis indicated useful accuracy of the SCL-90-R to screen for severe mental disorders. Optimal cut-off on the Global Severity Index between severe mental disorders and not having any severe mental disorder was 1.42. In conclusion, the SCL-90-R is a reliable and valid instrument, which may be useful to screen for severe mental disorders at admission to the prison system.},

Methods:               This study implements a perceptual measure of job quality (job satisfaction) and hybrid fixed effects models among a sample of high-risk adults. Analyses also consider the robustness of findings across alternative operationalizations of job quality and various sample subgroups.                                         Results:               Transitioning from not working to working in the lowest quality job can be criminogenic. Among those who are working, an improvement in job quality is not generally associated with offending. However, model and crime-specific effects are observed. Evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity is also found, suggesting the effect of job quality is moderated by race/ethnicity and location.                                         Conclusions:               These findings caution criminologists against making an assumption that employment is inversely related to offending and call into question our understanding of job quality as a general disincentive for crime. Rather, evidence suggests that improvements in job quality may result in modest reductions in offending, but only for certain types of crime and certain individuals within specific labor market contexts.},

  abstract = {Only in the past decade has prisoner reentry been "discovered" and become a centroal policy concern in the United States. This is due in part to the sheer number of released inmates (more than 600,000 annually) and in part to a movement that has defined the issue as "reentry". A growing number of programs have been created in prison and the community. Implementing them effectively, however, poses substantial challenges. A wide diversity of progrmas fall under the rubric and only a limited number of rigorous evaluations have been conducted. Research suggests that, overall, reentry services reduce recidivism, but program effects are heterogeneous and at times criminogenic. Effective programs tend to be consistent with the risk-need-reponsivity model. A sustained effort to evaluate carefully designed programs rigorously is needed and may require development of a "criminology of reentry". More needs to be understood about why recidivism rates are high in the first year after reentry, why some offenders have late-onset failure, whether sho comes come matters, and how stigma and other collateral consequences of conviction can managed.},

Few scholars have considered both the similarities and the differences in the predictors of offending among males and females and the implication of this for middle-range theories. Victimization has been put forth as a major explanatory factor for female offending; yet the study of female victimization has been ghettoized because it has failed to address the ways in which it is related to the larger literature of victimization. Female inmates have always been characterized as having special needs, but the basic necessities (housing and employment) inmates require once they are released from prison are in fact gender neutral. These bodies of research all have suggested that the salience of gender varies in different contexts and is intermixed with other forms of stratification. As such, we would do well to attend to those situations and relational processes that foreground gender and focus our efforts on where gender-based paradigms are important and can have a real impact.},

The current study capitalizes on a natural experiment to examine the impact of one particular component, length of service delivery, on recidivism. The study employs survival analysis techniques on a population of inmates graduating from a motivational boot camp who either received no aftercare, 30 days of aftercare, or 90 days of aftercare (depending on the existing policy on their graduation date). Findings show that those receiving 30 days of aftercare services are indistinguishable from those receiving no aftercare services in terms of recidivism. Also, we find that although those receiving 90 days of aftercare did recidivate substantially less than those receiving 0 or 30 days of aftercare, after accounting for sample attrition, however, these findings also lacked statistical significance.},

However, while finding and keeping a job are considered one of the key challenges inmates face as they move back into society, there is limited research on the dynamics and trajectories of post-prison employment. Little is also know about whether work characteristics and its relation to crime affect employment trajectories following release. Using data from the study ``Reintegration, desistance and recidivism among female inmates in Chile'' (RDFC), our paper describes trajectories of employment among a cohort of 225 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile and followed during the first year after release. We use sequence analysis to explore monthly patterns of employment considering different types of work (i.e., self-employed / employed, legitimate / under-the- table). To better account for the complex relationship between work and crime, we include offending as another type of income-generating activity. Finally, we use cluster analysis and regression models to explore which individual characteristics are associated with employment and offending trajectories.  Our results show a significant level of heterogeneity in employment trajectories by job type, and the importance of considering work and offending to obtain a more complete picture of the dynamics of employment during reentry.},

However, selection into and out of jobs could also explain the negative association between work and crime: people may start working when they are already offending less and stop working when they are already offending more. To evaluate these possibilities, I model month-to-month, within-person changes in offending during the periods surrounding job transitions. Using data from the Pathways to Desistance study, I analyze a sample of young, justice-involved men in two U.S. cities, Phoenix and Philadelphia. I find large reductions in income-related offending during the months leading up to job entry, after which there is no further decrease. I also find that offending spikes before job exit. These patterns suggest that for these young men, being employed does not reduce crime. Rather, employment transitions occur in response to other changes in their lives.},

On a variety of indicators, California is much more punitive than Minnesota. Using data from two original, large-N surveys, we analyze whether these differences in the orientations of state correctional systems are reflected in the attitudes of workers who are tasked with the day-to-day oversight of state prisons. With respect to the purpose of imprisonment, we find that California prison officers are significantly more punitive than those in Minnesota. In contrast, officers in each state express similar levels of support for basic rehabilitation programs. Based on these findings, we propose an embedded work role perspective, which posits that officers across states reflect a shared position within the prison organization, but that the prisons in which they work are embedded in broader penal and political environments that predict differences in attitudes across state contexts. This conceptualization of prison officer orientations has implications for policymakers, prison administrators, and scholars concerned with the politics and practice of work and incarceration.},

Although attachment to a prosocial spouse is an important social bond in the desistance of male offenders, male and female offenders have different offending and life experiences and are likely to draw romantic partners from very different groups. This article addresses this issue through an analysis of qualitative interviews with 49 female ex-offenders and their romantic partners. These women most often have relationships with recovering drug users and/or ex-offenders, not purely prosocial men or women. These relationships are dynamic and may be both destructive and conventionalizing at different points in time. Many women also consciously avoid romantic relationships, at least temporarily. These patterns of romantic relationships for female ex-offenders add to our understanding of the role of social bonds in desistance. This article emphasizes the need to look at relationships as processes rather than static events and to expand the definition of prosocial partners.},

A series of ground-based follow-up observations are being undertaken in order to remove contaminant objects (ultra-compact HII (UCHII) regions, planetary nebulae (PN), evolved stars), and to begin characterising these MYSOs. Aims: As a part of these follow-up observations, high resolution ({{\~}}1'') mid-IR imaging aids the identification of contaminant objects which are resolved (UCHII regions, PN) as opposed to those which are unresolved (YSOs, evolved stars) as well as identifying YSOs near UCHII regions and other multiple sources. Methods: We present 10.4 {$\mu$}m imaging observations for 346 candidate MYSOs in the RMS survey in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily outside the region covered by the GLIMPSE Spitzer Legacy Survey. These were obtained using TIMMI2 on the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla, Chile. Our photometric accuracy is of order 0.05 Jy, and our astrometric accuracy is 0.8'', which is an improvement over the nominal 2'' accuracy of the MSX PSC. Results: Point sources are detected in 64{{\%}} of our observations, which are expected to be either YSOs or evolved stars. 24{{\%}} contain only sources of extended emission, which are likely to be either UCHII regions or, in a few cases, PN. This is confirmed by comparison with radio continuum observations. We find that, as expected for a dusty HII region, the strength of 10.4 {$\mu$}m and radio continuum emission is related. The remaining targets (12{{\%}}) result in non-detections. While for 63{{\%}} of our targets we detect only one mid-infrared source, 25{{\%}} show multiple sources. In these cases, our observations will allow the apportioning of the flux from larger beam measurements between the different sources. Within these multiple source targets, we find some point sources on or near UCHII regions. Our improved astrometric information will allow more accurate targeting of spectroscopy, which will be used to identify unresolved sources in cases where it is not clear whether they are YSOs or evolved stars. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile (ESO Programmes 70.C-0069(A), 73.C-0314(A), 74.C-0267 and 077.C-0687(A)).}

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, two dominant themes have emerged in the study of desistance from crime: desistance is a gradual process, and embedded in the desistance process are important life events or turning points. Yet sociological and criminological empirical studies of desistance tend to focus on these two processes separately. Using a panel of serious offenders, we examine the progression over age of the probability of participation in legal employment and offending, and consider how past participation in one regime is associated with the decision to remain in or switch regimes. We model desistance from crime as a discrete-time Markovian process, which allows us to trace the process of desistance prospectively and to embed within it participation in legal work or not. We find that the conditional probabilities of being in certain states (e.g., legal employment, crime) are heavily dependent on one's prior state. Furthermore, we find that this process has inertia\textendash or memory\textendash in that the probability of legal employment increases and the probability of crime decreases, based on accumulated legal employment.

  abstract = {Over the recent past there have been several meta-analyses and primary studies that support the importance of the risk principle. Oftentimes these studies, particularly the meta-analyses, are limited in their ability to assess how the actual implementation of the risk principle by correctional agencies affects effectiveness in reducing recidivism. Furthermore, primary studies are typically limited to the assessment of one or two programs, which again limits the types of analyses conducted. This study, using data from two independent studies of 97 correctional programs, investigates how adherence to the risk principle by targeting offenders who are higher risk and varying length of stay and services by level of risk affects program effectiveness in reducing recidivism. Overall, this research indicates that for residential and nonresidential programs, adhering to the risk principle has a strong relationship with a program's ability to reduce recidivism.[/italic},

In this article we compare the cohorts born 1920\textendash 1950 in West Germany and Switzerland, whose adult life courses are characterized by similar strong male-breadwinner contexts in both countries. The countries differ in that Switzerland represented a liberal pension system, whereas Germany represented a corporatist protective pension system when these cohorts retired. We therefore assess how gendered work\textendash family life courses that developed in similar male-breadwinner contexts are related to financial well-being in retirement in different pension systems. Using data from the SHARELIFE survey we conduct multichannel sequence analysis and cluster analysis to identify groups of typical work\textendash family life courses from ages 20 to 59. Regression models estimate how these groups are associated with the individual pension income and household income in retirement. Results show that women who combined motherhood with part time work and extended periods out of the labour force have even lower individual pension income in Switzerland compared to their German peers. This relative disadvantage partly extends to lower household income in retirement. Findings support that male breadwinner policies earlier in life combined with liberal pension policies later in life, as in Switzerland, intensify pension penalties for typical female work\textendash family life courses of early motherhood and weak labour force attachment. We conclude that life course sensitive social policies should harmonize regulations, which are in effect earlier in life with policies later in life for specific birth cohorts.},

  abstract = {Prior research suggests a correlation between incarceration and marital dissolution, although questions remain as to why this association exists. Is it the stigma associated with ``doing time'' that drives couples apart? Or is it simply the duration of physical separation that leads to divorce? This research utilizes data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) and the Survey of Officer and Enlisted Personnel to shed light on these questions. The findings generally support a separation explanation of the incarceration-divorce relationship. Specifically, the data show that exposure to incarceration has no effect on marital dissolution after duration of incarceration is taken into account. In addition, across both datasets we find that individuals who spend substantial time away from spouses are at higher risk of divorce. The findings point to the importance of spousal separation for understanding the incarceration-marital dissolution relationship. Moreover, and in contrast to settings in which stigma appears quite salient (e.g., labor markets), our results suggest that the shared history and degree of intimacy among married partners may weaken the salience of the stigma of incarceration. Findings are discussed in the context of a burgeoning body of work on the collateral consequences of incarceration and have implications for the growing pool of men in American society returning from prison.},

Contrary to previous findings, the results demonstrated no significant gender differences for recidivism rates, although significant gender differences were found for those who had reoffended with property and prostitution offenses. Similar to previous findings, age and total arrests were significant predictors for both male and female offenders. In the current sample, substance abuse was predictive for male offenders only. Although no gender differences were found across the recidivism predictors of static and criminogenic need, the protective factors of positive social support significantly predicted recidivism for female offenders and not male offenders. The current results add to the understanding of gender differences for the assessment, risk prediction, and treatment of offenders. \textcopyright{} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

In addition, young men with previous convictions who reported feeling stigmatized were less likely to reoffend.

Despite increasing policy attention in the UK and elsewhere to prisoner resettlement, women's experiences on release from prison have received limited empirical and policy attention. Drawing upon interviews with women leaving prison in Victoria, Australia, this article discusses the resettlement challenges faced by the women and highlights their similarity to the experiences of women leaving prison in other jurisdictions. Women had mixed (and predominantly negative) experiences and views of accessing services and supports following release, though experiences of parole supervision by community corrections offi cers were often positive, especially if women felt valued and supported by workers who demonstrated genuine concern. Analysis of factors associated with further offending and with desistance, points to the critical role of fl exible, tailored and women-centred post-release support building, and, where possible, upon relationships established with women while they are still in prison.},

However, multivariate survival analysis of 1,632 parolees released to Newark during July 2007 to June 2009 found little evidence that these factors increased the risk of failure. Successful operationalization of environmental risk will probably need to incorporate more detailed measures of parolees' routine activities, including the settings and paths they frequent beyond their home environment.},

The present study aimed to assess comorbidities of substance use disorders with other mental disorders in female prisoners at admission to a penal justice system. Methods A sample of 150 female prisoners, consecutively admitted to the penal justice system of Berlin, Germany, was interviewed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The presence of borderline personality disorder was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview II for DSM-IV. Prevalence rates and comorbidities were calculated as percentage values and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Ninety-three prisoners (62\%; 95\% CI: 54\textendash 70) had substance use disorders; n=49 (33\%; 95\% CI: 24\textendash 42) had alcohol abuse/dependence; n=76 (51\%; 95\% CI: 43\textendash 59) had illicit drug abuse/dependence; and n=53 (35\%; 95\% CI: 28\textendash 44) had opiate use disorders. In the group of inmates with substance use disorders, 84 (90\%) had at least one other mental disorder; n=63 (68\%) had comorbid affective disorders; n=45 (49\%) had borderline or antisocial personality disorders; and n=41 (44\%) had comorbid anxiety disorders. Conclusions Female prisoners with addiction have high rates of comorbid mental disorders at admission to the penal justice system, ranging from affective to personality and anxiety disorders. Generic and robust interventions that can address different comorbid mental health problems in a flexible manner may be required to tackle widespread addiction and improve mental health of female prisoners.},

  abstract = {This collection examines the mutually influential interactions of gender and the state in Latin America from the late colonial period to the end of the twentieth century. Locating watershed moments in the processes of gender construction by the organized power of the ruling classes and in the processes by which gender has conditioned state-making, Hidden Histories of Gender and the State in Latin America remedies the lack of such considerations in previous studies of state formation.Along these lines, the book begins with two theoretical chapters by the editors, Elizabeth Dore and Maxine Molyneux. Dore opens by arguing against the prevailing view that the nineteenth century was marked by a gradual emancipation of women, while Molyneux considers how various Latin American state forms\textemdash liberal, corporatist, socialist, neoliberal\textemdash have more recently sought to incorporate women into their projects of social reform and modernization. These essays are followed by twelve case studies that examine how states have contributed to the normalization of male and female roles and relations. Covering an impressive breadth not only of historical time but also of geographical scope, this volume moves from Brazil to Costa Rica, from Mexico to Chile, traversing many countries in between. Contributors explore such topics as civic ritual in Bolivia, rape in war-torn Colombia, and the legal construction of patriarchy in Argentina. They examine the public regulation of domestic life, feminist lobby groups, class compromise, female slaves, and women in rural households\textemdash distinct, salient aspects of the state-gender relationship in specific countries at specific historical junctures.By providing a richly descriptive and theoretically grounded account of the interaction between state and gender politics in Latin America, this volume contributes to an important conversation between feminists interested in the state and political scientists interested in gender. It will be valuable to such disciplines as history, sociology, international comparative studies, and Latin American studies.Contributors.

Results indicate higher levels of family conflict coincide with increased odds of drug use and crime immediately following release from prison. A multinomial logistic model indicates patterns of drug use at specific points in time directly coincide with patterns of family conflict, but not family support. The implications of these findings are addressed.},

The present study aimed to establish prevalence rates of mental disorders in Chilean prisoners. Method: A nationwide random sample of 1008 prisoners was assessed in 7 penal institutions throughout Chile. Twelve-month prevalence rates were established using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and compared to the prevalence rates previously published for the general population. Results: Prevalence rates were 12.2\% (95\% CI, 10.2-14.1) for any substance use disorder, 8.3\% (6.6-10.0) for anxiety disorders, 8.1\% (6.5-9.8) for affective disorders, 5.7\% (4.4-7.1) for intermittent explosive disorders, 2.2\% (1.4-3.2) for ADHD of the adult, and 0.8\% (0.3-1.3) for non-affective psychoses. Significantly higher prevalence rates among prisoners as compared to the general population in Chile were seen for major depression (6.1\% vs. 3.7\% males, Z=2.58, p{$<$}0.05) and illicit drug use (3.3\% vs. 0.6\% males with drug abuse, Z=2.04, p{$<$}0.05; 2.6\% vs. 0.1\% females with drug abuse, Z=5.36, p{$<$}0.001; 3.4\% vs. 1.1\% males with drug dependence, Z=3.70; p{$<$}0.001). Dysthymia (6.5\% vs. 15.6\%, Z=-2.39, p{$<$}0.05), simple (3.3\% vs. 11.5\%, Z=-3.13, p{$<$}0.001) and social phobias (3.9\% vs. 9.7\%, Z=2.38, p{$<$}0.05) were significantly less frequent in the female prison population than in the general population. One-year prevalence rates of alcohol abuse (2.3\% vs. 3.9\%; Z=-2.04; p{$<$}0.05) and dependence (2.7\% vs. 8.2\%; Z=-5.24; p{$<$}0.001) were less prevalent in the male prison population than in the general population. Conclusions: Service provision for prison populations in Chile should acknowledge high rates of depression and illicit drug use. Overall prevalence rates are lower than reported in other LMICs. Previous research in prison populations in LMICs might have overestimated prevalence rates of mental disorders.},

  abstract = {Background. Previous mental health surveys conducted in prisons within emerging countries recruited samples of all prisoners at any single point in time. However, this sampling strategy results in an overrepresentation of long-term prisoners as compared with those studies recruiting from all admissions over time. This study aimed to assess mental disorders in consecutively admitted prisoners soon after admission, in order to address service needs of people with short-term imprisonments and people at early stages of imprisonment. Method. Disorders were assessed in a sample of 229 male and 198 female prisoners, consecutively committed to the penal justice system in Santiago de Chile, using the structured Mini-Neuropsychiatric interview. Prevalence rates were calculated as per cent values. Ninety-five per cent confidence intervals were calculated for the proportions. Results. Illicit drug and/or alcohol use disorders in the year prior to admission were present in 173 (76{{\%}}) male and 64 (32{{\%}}) female prisoners. The substances most frequently causing addiction were cocaine-based products in 108 (47{{\%}}) male and 42 (21{{\%}}) female prisoners. Current major depression was present in 124 (54{{\%}}) male and 86 (43{{\%}}) female prisoners, and current non-affective psychotic disorders in 18 (8{{\%}}) male and in 10 (5{{\%}}) female prisoners. High suicidal risk was present in 64 (28{{\%}}) male prisoners and in 29 (15{{\%}}) female prisoners. Conclusion. When consecutive prisoners are assessed at admission, rates of mental health and substance use disorders were higher than in previous studies in emerging countries that had sampled from all existing prisoners at a time. Affective disorders and suicide risk appear more prevalent than in admission studies conducted in Western high-income countries. Previous research may have systematically underestimated the extent of mental health problems in prisoners, which poses a major public health challenge in emerging countries.},

  abstract = {Criminological research has consistently uncovered a positive correlation between past and current criminal behavior. Continuity in offending over time can be attributed to at least two processes\textemdash population heterogeneity and state dependence. A population heterogeneity process attributes stability in offending over time to differences in an anti-social characteristic (self-control, impulsivity, psychopathic personality) across persons that is established early in life and time- stable thereafter. An implication of a population heterogeneity explanation for continuity in offending over time is that the anti-social characteristic is likely to have reverberations throughout life, taking many manifestations later in life (unemployment, drug addiction, marital instability). Any observed correlation between these later life events and criminality, therefore, is spurious rather than causal, due to the fact that they are all the effects of a common cause. A state dependence explanation, in contrast, attributes observed stability in criminal offending to a process of contagion. That is, criminal behavior has a genuine causal effect on subsequent criminality by eroding constraints and strengthening incentives to crime. The implication of a state dependence process is that criminal conduct may be influenced by later life events. In this paper, we draw a connec- tion between population heterogeneity and state dependence processes and extant criminological theory. We also review the literature that has investigated the plausibility of these two processes. Finally, concluding that we know very little about them we make recommendations for future research on population hetero- geneity and state dependence.},

Faced with the prison population growth together with the economic downturn and budget crises, many states are seeking ways to break the increasing cycle of recidivism. Although research on recidivism and desistance has not always learned from each other, recently, there is an increasing convergence of these two streams of research. This convergence has been stimulated by a variety of factors, but most notably, it draws from emerging research on redemption, which focuses on the inverse relationship between recidivism risk and time since previous contact with the criminal justice system. Although the concepts of recidivism, desistance, and redemption are all about continuity and change in criminal offending over time, the relationship between the three has not been examined. In this paper, we discuss the interface between recidivism and desistance research with a particular focus on redemption research; point out one emerging consensus from both recidivism and desistance research, namely, the importance of offenders' motivation and individual internal change; and discuss new ideas to effectively improve our approaches of reducing recidivism and facilitating desistance.},

  abstract = {After decades of stability from the 1920s to the early 1970s, the rate of imprisonment in the United States more than quadrupled during the last four decades. The U.S. penal population of 2.2 million adults is by far the largest in the world. Just under one-quarter of the world's prisoners are held in American prisons. The U.S. rate of incarceration, with nearly 1 out of every 100 adults in prison or jail, is 5 to 10 times higher than the rates in Western Europe and other democracies. The U.S. prison population is largely drawn from the most disadvantaged part of the nation's population: mostly men under age 40, disproportionately minority, and poorly educated. Prisoners often carry additional deficits of drug and alcohol addictions, mental and physical illnesses, and lack of work preparation or experience. The growth of incarceration in the United States during four decades has prompted numerous critiques and a growing body of scientific knowledge about what prompted the rise and what its consequences have been for the people imprisoned, their families and communities, and for U.S. society.nTheGrowth of Incarceration in the United States examines research and analysis of the dramatic rise of incarceration rates and its affects. This study makes the case that the United States has gone far past the point where the numbers of people in prison can be justified by social benefits and has reached a level where these high rates of incarceration themselves constitute a source of injustice and social harm.nTheGrowth of Incarceration in the United States recommends changes in sentencing policy, prison policy, and social policy to reduce the nation's reliance on incarceration. The report also identifies important research questions that must be answered to provide a firmer basis for policy. The study assesses the evidence and its implications for public policy to inform an extensive and thoughtful public debate about and reconsideration of policies.}

In this review, we consider how criminologists have sought to identify change in the criminal career by reflecting on the identification and measurement of turning points. We contend that important life events, such as marriage and employment, are endogenous to the desistance process and as such present challenges for scholars regarding the causal identification of turning points. Specifically, we argue that both selection bias and simultaneity bias are fundamental principles of the life-course framework. We present a formal way to think about the causal identification of turning points in the face of endogeneity and also consider several conceptual issues relating to the definition and measurement of turning points. In the end, we encourage scholars to adopt creative methodological strategies to unpack turning points.},

Postrelease interviews included six items that tapped into criminal human capital and criminal social capital acquired in prison. Factor structure was examined with confirmatory factor analysis, and item response theory was used to examine each of the items. Regression models examined concurrent validity for the criminal capital construct on the willingness to offend, perceived rewards to crime, illegal earnings expectations, and making money from crime. Results: Criminal human capital and criminal social capital acquired in prison represent a single unidimensional latent construct. Regression models demonstrated concurrent validity for the criminal capital construct. Conclusions: Working toward a consistent conceptualization of criminal capital is important for a cohesive body of knowledge. Future work should investigate how dimensionality and validity differ across contexts.},

Because of the increasing re-marketization of retirement provisions, wealth is becoming increasingly important for retirees' economic well-being. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017), we conduct sequence and cluster analyses to identify groups of typical employment trajectories of men and women in Eastern and Western Germany. For men, we find that continuous full-time employment is positively associated with net wealth at older ages, whereas early retirement and long-term unemployment are negatively associated with wealth. These associations are similar for housing and non-housing wealth in both contexts. For women in Western Germany, a low labour market participation is associated with higher levels of housing wealth and lower levels of non-housing wealth compared with female full-time employees. The results point to gendered wealth accumulation due to differences in men's and women's labour market participation in gender-unequal welfare state contexts. The associations between employment and wealth are slightly weaker in Eastern Germany, indicating that the socialist regime of the GDR restricted the ability to accumulate wealth.},

Multivariate analyses utilize Cox propor-tional hazards survival tests. Results indicate that after approximately 3 years of follow-up time, those released to supervision were generally less involved in new crimes when compared with those who were released uncondition-ally.

  abstract = {Decades of racial progress have led some researchers and policymakers to doubt that discrimination remains an important cause of economic inequality. To study contemporary discrimination, we conducted a field experiment in the low-wage labor market of New York City, recruiting white, black, and Latino job applicants who were matched on demographic characteristics and interpersonal skills. These applicants were given equivalent r\'esum\'es and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants' experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers.},

Three-year follow-up data for recidivism and post-release drug use were analyzed using survival analysis methods. Despite the greater number of life problems among women than men, women had lower three-year recidivism rates and rates of post-release drug use than did men. For both men and women, treated subjects had longer survival times than those who were not treated. There were both similarities and differences with respect to gender and the other predictors of the two post-release outcomes. Differences in background characteristics and in factors related to post-release outcomes for men and women suggest the plausibility of gender-specific paths in the recovery process.

This study's goal is to further develop our understanding of the process of desisting from gangs.

Using a detention sample of juvenile arrestees, the authors first compare differences between 156 current and 83 former gang members at a bivariate level. This is followed by a multivariate analysis of former gang members that (a) examines factors that predict increases of ties to the former gang network and (b) illustrates the importance of gang ties by exploring their effects on victimization. The findings shed light on the correlates and consequences of persisting gang ties. In particular, it is found that ties have direct positive effects on recent victimizations. More important, it is found that longer lengths of desistance matter to the extent that ties are diminished; that is, length of desistance operates indirectly through gang ties to reduce victimization. The study concludes with a discussion of the conceptual and policy implications surrounding gang desistance and how lingering ties to the former gang network are crucial to understanding the desistance process.},

Several theories state that employment can reduce these risks but emphasize that the protective role of employment is conditional on job qualities (work intensity, job duration, etc.). Longitudinal research on the role of employment in ex-prisoners' recidivism patterns is scarce, and most existing work used a simplistic employment measure (i.e., employed vs. unemployed), leaving the topic of job quality underexplored. This study examines the association between employment characteristics and recidivism among Dutch ex-prisoners. Using longitudinal data of the Prison Project (n = 714), we found that not just any job, but particularly stable employment and jobs with a higher occupational level could help reduce crime rates among these high-risk offenders. Many ex-prisoners face a human capital deficit that complicates the guidance to high-quality jobs. It might, however, be possible to help place ex-prisoners in stable employment.},

Regardless of the name, the method capitalizes on what is known about the storage of autobiographical memory and involves entering key time markers on a calendar in order to facilitate the recall of events and life circumstances. With increased use of the LEC across a variety of disciplines, more attention has been focused on this method and on the quality of data resulting from its use. Early reviews of the method and its utility were provided by Freedman et al. (1988) and by Caspi et al. (1996). More recently, Belli and colleagues have written extensively about the method's theoretical foundations and have conducted important research comparing the LEC to more traditional methodological approaches (Belli 1998; Belli et al. 2001, 2007, 2009).}

In this article we develop an efficient and convenient method for answering such questions. The basic model presumes that two types of variables have been measured: response variables (possibly longitudinal) that partially determine the latent class membership, and covariates or risk factors that we wish to relate to these latent class variables. The model assumes that these observable variables are conditionally independent, given the latent class variable. We use a mixture model for the joint distribution of the observables. We apply this model to a longitudinal dataset assembled as part of the Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development to test a fundamental theory of criminal development. This theory holds that crime is committed by two distinct groups within the population: adolescent-limited offenders and life-course-persistent offenders. As these labels suggest, the two groups are distinguished by the longevity of their offending careers. The theory also predicts that life-course-persistent offenders are disproportionately comprised of individuals born with neurological deficits and reared by caregivers without the skills and resources to effectively socialize a difficult child},

As a result, many of the needs unique to women are not formally assessed or treated. Emerging research advocating a gender-responsive approach to the supervision and treatment of women offenders suggests that needs such as abuse, mental health, substance abuse, relationship difficulties, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and parenting issues are important treatment targets. Although these needs may be highly prevalent among women offenders, they have not been adequately tested to determine their relationships with future offending. In response, the present study sought to understand whether gender-responsive needs contributed as risk factors to poor prison adjustment and community recidivism. Additionally, several types of risk assessment models were explored to determine whether gender-responsive needs enhanced the validities of currently established risk classification systems (i.e., a state's institutional custody scale and the Level of Service Inventory-Revised). Patterns of results differed across prison and community outcomes, with some gender-responsive needs contributing to more valid risk assessment systems. As a pilot study, the results, although mixed, appear to support continued research on this topic.},

Incarceration might have powerful effects on health, especially if it instills stigma, and it could provide sociologists with another mechanism for understanding health disparities. This study identifies some of incarceration's direct and indirect effects and rigorously tests them using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. It finds that incarceration has powerful effects on health, but only after release. A history of incarceration strongly increases the likelihood of severe health limitations. Furthermore, any contact with prison is generally more important than the amount of contact, a finding consistent with a stigma-based interpretation. Although this relationship is partly attributable to diminished wage growth and marital instability, the bulk of the effect remains even under the most stringent of specifications, including controls for intelligence and the use of fixed effects, suggesting a far-reaching process with a proliferation of risk factors. The study also finds that incarceration contributes only modestly to racial disparities, that there are few synergistic interactions between incarceration and other features of inequality, including schooling, and that the evidence for a causal effect is much weaker among persistent recidivists and those serving exceptionally long sentences. These study findings are inconsistent with recent speculation; nevertheless, incarceration is an important addition to sociology's research agenda. Exploring incarceration could lead to, among other things, a fruitful synergy among studies on fundamental causes, stigma, and stress.},

A putative causal relationship is contaminated by assorted influences, including childhood disadvantage, the early onset of most disorders, and the criminalization of substance use. Using the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (N = 5692), we examine the relationship between incarceration and psychiatric disorders after statistically adjusting for multidimensional influences. The results indicate that (1) some of the most common disorders found among former inmates emerge in childhood and adolescence and therefore predate incarceration; (2) the relationships between incarceration and disorders are smaller for current disorders than lifetime disorders, suggesting that the relationship between incarceration and disorders dissipates over time; and (3) early substance disorders anticipate later incarceration and other psychiatric disorders simultaneously, indicating selection. Yet the results also reveal robust and long-lasting relationships between incarceration and certain disorders, which are not inconsequential for being particular. Specifically, incarceration is related to subsequent mood disorders, related to feeling ``down,'' including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia. These disorders, in turn, are strongly related to disability, more strongly than substance abuse disorders and impulse control disorders. Although often neglected as a health consequence of incarceration, mood disorders might explain some of the additional disability former inmates experience following release, elevating their relevance for those interested in prisoner reintegration.},

Although there is an increasing female parole population, there has been a paucity of research concerning female parol-ees. The current study examines the types of needs identified at intake from a sample of 546 female parolees. The results revealed the following. First, if a parolee was employed, had stable living arrangements, and was assessed as needing and receiving some type of drug and/or alcohol program intervention, she was less likely to fail on parole. Second, many of these women were underassessed for having needs for drug and alcohol treat-ment as well as employment, housing, and other assistance. This underassessment may be because of an increasing emphasis on parole supervision (i.e., custody) rather than treatment in parole agencies.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Although studies of General Strain Theory (GST) typically include measures of physical health in multi-item indices of strain, no work has investigated the independent influence of physical health on criminal offending. The current research explores the relationship between physical health and criminal offending among low-income women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Methods: Using data from the Welfare, Children, and Families (WCF) project, criminal behavior is predicted over two years with measures of physical health, depression, anxiety, competing strain, and relevant background factors. Results: Poorer physical health at baseline and declines in physical health increase the odds of offending onset among previous non-offenders and reduce the odds of decreased offending among previous offenders. In offending onset models, higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline and increases in these symptoms partially mediate the effect of poorer baseline health and fully mediate the effect of the loss of physical health. In decreased offending models, increases in anxiety and depression fully mediate the effect of poorer baseline health and partially mediate the effect of the loss of physical health. Conclusions: The data suggest that poor health and declines in physical health influence both offending onset and offending escalation directly and indirectly through increases in anxiety and depression. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We also find evidence that parole, contrary to many expectations, increases the odds of employment.

These women frequently tell of histories of physical and/or sexual victimisation and when compared to incarcerated men, they are more than three times as likely to report having experienced physical or sexual abuse prior to their incarcerations (ACA 1990; Greene 2000; Greenfeld and Snell 1999; Harlow 1998; Snell and Morton 1994; Veysey 1998). Many incarcerated women also report being victims of youth maltreatment, having injuries caused by chronic neglect, physical abuse and assault, and sexual abuse (Cicchetti and Carlson 1989; Wolfe 1999). Children who have been maltreated suffer emotional and social injuries, accompanied by a loss of trust in others and a diminished desire to ask for help or to disclose one's problems or vulnerabilities (Bellis et al. 2001; Berry 2001; Besharov and Laumann 1997; Briere 1992; Cowen 1999; Dore 1999; Hampton 1995; Kirby and Fraser 1997; Kurtz et al. 1993).}

Motherhood frequently motivated the women to desist from crime, most notably in order to avoid their children experiencing the scrutiny and harmful state interventions that had such a profoundly negative impact on their own young lives. However, I conclude that many ex-offending mothers continue to be stigmatized as maternally deficient long after they have left crime behind.},

We combine novel, real-time GPS information on daytime locations and self-reported employment collected from smartphones with sophisticated measures of job accessibility to test the relative importance of spatial mismatch based on residence and daytime locations. Our findings suggest that the ability of low-skilled, poor, and urban individuals to compensate for their residential deficits by traveling to job-rich areas is an overlooked and salient consideration in spatial mismatch perspectives.},

The risk of having a parent currently or ever incarcerated is disproportionately concentrated among black children and children of high school dropouts, many of whom are noncustodial parents. Variation in question wording, differences in length of exposure to parental incarceration, and the measurement of residential parenthood in household-based sample surveys converge to produce different estimates of race and class inequality in having a parent currently or ever incarcerated, when compared to similar estimates of parental incarceration from inmate surveys. Drawing on data from multiple sources and the development of a new method for the estimation of multiple-partner fertility among inmates, we consider how race and class inequality in parental incarceration may contribute to family complexity and the reproduction of childhood disadvantage.},

  abstract = {For the past three decades the rate of incarceration in the U.S. has steadily and dramatically increased to the point where it is higher than it has ever been anywhere before. As a society, we are embarking on an unprecedented social experiment: the extensive use of mass incarceration as our response to crime. An underappreciated aspect of this boom in incarceration is the ``iron law of imprisonment''\textemdash that all prisoners (except for the very few who die while incarcerated) eventually return to society. In 2002, 630,000 individuals (over 1,700 per day) reentered society, a vast change from the 150,000 annual prison releases of 30 years ago. Many of these individuals are released to urban communities already burdened with high rates of crime, poverty and addiction. After a six year stint as head of the National Institute of Justice and before becoming the president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Jeremy Travis spent five years as a Senior Fellow at The Urban Institute studying the phenomenon of prisoner reentry. This book is the result of his studies. It focuses only on issues related to the reentry of people from federal and state prisons, not jails, of which there are about ten times as many annual releases. It also does not address health care within correctional facilities. The book gives an excellent overview of the problem of increased imprisonment. It is divided into three parts: 1) how sentencing policies have changed and created this new reality, 2) how the current realities of incarceration and reentry affect seven policy domains and 3) suggested new policy directions. The first part goes into some detail in describing the changes in sentencing policies that began in the 1970s. Prior to that, judges, correctional administrators and parole boards had considerable autonomy in determining the length of incarceration, and there was a common goal of rehabilitation and re-integration. Defense lawyers and activists on the left, concerned about racial and class disparities, pushed for limiting discretion in sentencing. Concurrently, political conservatives on the right, concerned about rising crime and questionable effectiveness of rehabilitation programs, pushed for limiting discretion. The result was a series of sentencing reform bills such as ``truth in sentencing'' ``mandatory minimums'' and ``three strikes and you're out'' that removed discretion and substantially contributed to mass incarceration. Furthermore, a series of ``collateral sanctions'' were imposed including reduced access to jobs, housing, welfare, voting rights and even parental rights. Current correctional sentencing policy and practice has no unifying philosophy. ``Just desserts, retribution, and incapacitation for crime control purposes'' are more often championed than rehabilitation. Whatever the underlying philosophy of incarceration, however, the sheer numbers of individuals returning to society require that we address the problem of reentry. The second part views the reality of reentry from seven different perspectives\textemdash public safety, families and children, work, housing, public health, civic identity, and community capacity. Each description includes examples of successes and suggested policy changes. The third part goes beyond the small demonstration programs and minor policy changes and proposes a framework for policy reform. This part is a ``how to'' for implementing necessary policy changes, including five guiding principles for successful reentry\textemdash prepare for reentry, build bridges between prisons and communities, seize the moment of release, strengthen the concentric circles of support and promote successful reintegration. This book provides an excellent a review of current research and knowledge on incarceration and reentry (although it could emphasize more the dramatic contribution of the epidemic of drug use to incarceration and the public health imperative to address the massive burden of disease in this population). However it also provides much more. The stated goal is ``to promote new ways of thinking, encourage innovation, challenge existing orthodoxy, and spur policy reform.'' Hopefully it will succeed. This book should be read by all who are concerned about urban health, crime, incarceration and social justice.}

We evaluate whether there are gender differences in the predictors of both self-reported illegal earnings and arrest among samples of recently released male and female offenders. Our analysis of gender differences illustrates how both the behavior of the offender and the behavior of law shape our understanding of the transition out of crime. We analyze event history data from a large-scale social experiment that provided employment to male and female offenders. The results indicate that (1) gender differences in the predictors of desistance largely depend on the domain of behavior under consideration; (2) indicators of normative status, as opposed to the perceived risks of crime or age-graded informal controls, are particularly important determinants of women's risks of rearrest.},

  abstract = {Second edition. The goal of this book is to put an array of tools at the fingertips of students, practitioners, and researchers by explaining approaches long used by survey statisticians, illustrating how existing software can be used to solve survey problems, and developing some specialized software where needed. This volume serves at least three audiences: (1) students of applied sampling techniques; 2) practicing survey statisticians applying concepts learned in theoretical or applied sampling courses; and (3) social scientists and other survey practitioners who design, select, and weight survey samples. The text thoroughly covers fundamental aspects of survey sampling, such as sample size calculation (with examples for both single- and multi-stage sample design) and weight computation, accompanied by software examples to facilitate implementation. Features include step-by-step instructions for calculating survey weights, extensive real-world examples and applications, and representative programming code in R, SAS, and other packages. Since the publication of the first edition in 2013, there have been important developments in making inferences from nonprobability samples, in address-based sampling (ABS), and in the application of machine learning techniques for survey estimation. New to this revised and expanded edition: \textbullet{} Details on new functions in the PracTools package \textbullet{} Additional machine learning methods to form weighting classes \textbullet{} New coverage of nonlinear optimization algorithms for sample allocation \textbullet{} Reflecting effects of multiple weighting steps (nonresponse and calibration) on standard errors \textbullet{} A new chapter on nonprobability sampling \textbullet{} Additional examples, exercises, and updated references throughout Richard Valliant, PhD, is Research Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan and at the Joint Program in Survey Methodology at the University of Maryland.

However, according to a national study, within 3 years, almost 7 in 10 will have been rearrested and half will be back in prison, either for a new crime or for violating conditions of their release. Clearly, an individual's transition from prison back into a home and into a community is difficult, and avoiding crime can be the least of his or her problems. Understanding these pathways and the reasons for and the dimensions of an individual's success or failure is the focus of recent scholarly attention to the problem of ``prisoner reentry,'' the process of leaving prison and returning to free society. However, most of the existing research on prisoners' lives after release focuses solely on recidivism and ignores the reality that recidivism is directly affected by postprison reintegration and adjustment, which, in turn, depends on four sets of factors: personal and situational characteri...},

Ex-offenders, especially those recently released from prison, face substantial barriers to many types of legal employment; nonetheless, stable employment is one of the best predictors of post-release success. Thus, policy-makers concerned about high recidivism rates face an obvious need to improve the employment prospects of ex-offenders. Over the last 25 years, many programs that were designed to increase employment (and, by so doing, reduce recidivism) among ex-offenders have been implemented and evaluated. [Wilson, D. B., Gallagher, C. A., Coggeshall, M. B. \& MacKenzie, D. L. (1999). Corrections Management Quarterly 3(4), 8Y18; Wilson, D. B., Gallagher, C. A. \& MacKenzie, D. L. (2000). Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 37(4), 347Y368] conducted a quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis of 33 evaluations of educational, vocational, and work programs for persons in correctional facilities. To date, however, the evaluation literature on employment programs for those with a criminal record who are not in custody has not been systematically reviewed. This paper presents the results of a quantitative meta-analysis of eight random assignment studies of such programs, using the Campbell Collaboration methodology. The results indicate that this group of community employment programs for ex-offenders did not reduce recidivism; however, the experimental design research on this question is small and does not include some of the promising community employment programs that have emerged in the last decade.},

Using a causal framework, this paper examines the employment experiences of a multi-state sample of former prisoners, and identifies the individual factors influencing the likelihood of employment after release from prison, using data gathered from interviews with prisoners before and at multiple times after release. Findings indicate that consistent work experience before incarceration, connection to employers before release, and conventional family relationships improve employment outcomes after release. Individuals who relapse to drug use quickly after release, have chronic physical or mental health problems, and are older or nonwhite are employed fewer months after a period of incarceration.},

  abstract = {An unrelenting prison boom, marked by stark racial disparities, pulled a disproportionate number of young black men into prison in the last forty years. In Children of the Prison Boom, Sara Wakefield and Christopher Wildeman draw upon broadly representative survey data and interviews to describe the devastating effects of America's experiment in mass incarceration on a generation of vulnerable children tied to these men. In so doing, they show that the effects of mass imprisonment may be even greater on the children left behind than on the men who were locked up. Parental imprisonment has been transformed from an event affecting only the unluckiest of children-those with parents seriously involved in crime-to one that is remarkably common, especially for black children. This book documents how, even for children at high risk of problems, paternal incarceration makes a bad situation worse, increasing mental health and behavioral problems, infant mortality, and child homelessness. Pushing against prevailing understandings of and research on the consequences of mass incarceration for inequality among adult men, these harms to children translate into large-scale increases in racial inequalities. Parental imprisonment has become a distinctively American way of perpetuating intergenerational inequality-one that should be placed alongside a decaying public education system and concentrated disadvantage in urban centers as a factor that disproportionately touches, and disadvantages, poor black children. More troubling, even if incarceration rates were reduced dramatically in the near future, the long-term harms of our national experiment in the mass incarceration of marginalized men are yet to be fully revealed. Optimism about current reductions in the imprisonment rate and the resilience of children must therefore be set against the backdrop of the children of the prison boom-a lost generation now coming of age.},

They also found that they differed in the assignment of individuals to trajectory groups.

We compared chemical extraction and mathematical correction methods for freshwater and marine fishes and aquatic invertebrates to better understand impacts of correction approaches on carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) stable isotope data. 3. Fish and aquatic invertebrate tissue delta(13)C values increased significantly following extraction for almost all species and tissue types relative to nonextracted samples. In contrast, delta(15)N was affected for muscle and whole body samples from only a few freshwater and marine species and had a limited effect for the entire data set. 4. Lipid normalization models, using C : N as a proxy for lipid content, predicted lipid-corrected delta(13)C for paired data sets more closely with parameters specific to the tissue type and species to which they were applied. 5. We present species- and tissue-specific models based on bulk C : N as a reliable alternative to chemical extraction corrections. By analysing a subset of samples before and after lipid extraction, models can be applied to the species and tissues of interest that will improve estimates of dietary sources using stable isotopes.},

Despite these claims, few studies have directly observed either economic insecurity or the full extent of family complexity. We study parent-child relationships with a unique data set that includes detailed information about economic insecurity and family complexity among parents just released from prison. We find that stable private housing, more than income, is associated with close and regular contact between parents and children. Formerly incarcerated parents see their children less regularly in contexts of multiple-partner fertility and in the absence of supportive family relationships. Significant housing and family effects are estimated even after we control for drug use and crime, which are themselves negatively related to parental contact. The findings point to the constraints of material insecurity and the complexity of family relationships on the contact between formerly incarcerated parents and their children.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}In this Series paper, we examine how mass incarceration shapes inequality in health. The USA is the world leader in incarceration, which disproportionately affects black populations. Nearly one in three black men will ever be imprisoned, and nearly half of black women currently have a family member or extended family member who is in prison. However, until recently the public health implications of mass incarceration were unclear. Most research in this area has focused on the health of current and former inmates, with findings suggesting that incarceration could produce some short-term improvements in physical health during imprisonment but has profoundly harmful effects on physical and mental health after release. The emerging literature on the family and community effects of mass incarceration points to negative health impacts on the female partners and children of incarcerated men, and raises concerns that excessive incarceration could harm entire communities and thus might partly underlie health disparities both in the USA and between the USA and other developed countries. Research into interventions, policies, and practices that could mitigate the harms of incarceration and the post-incarceration period is urgently needed, particularly studies using rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The authors review the evidence base for the effectiveness of programs for girls in custody or under supervision by examining the evaluation evidence for nine gender-specific programs (which exclusively target girls) and six gender-non-specific programs (which target both girls and boys). Through this process, the authors summarize the evidence of effectiveness available to researchers and practitioners, identify barriers to determining what programs work for adjudicated girls, and make recommendations for building a solid evidence base on what works for adjudicated girls.},

  abstract = {In the late 1990s, California legislators funded a statewide, community-based correctional program intended to reduce parolee recidivism. Overseen by the California Department of Corrections, the Preventing Parolee Crime Program (PPCP) provided literacy training, employment services, housing assistance, and substance abuse treatment to tens of thousands of parolees. The study found that the PPCP produced modest reductions in reincarcerations and parole absconding, creating the potential for substantial long-term cost savings for California taxpayers. Because the PPCP's positive effects were strongest for parolees who completed their services, future program designers and administrators should consider including mechanisms to improve parolee retention and service utilization. This study also points out the potential benefits of incorporating rigorous evaluation plans into the design and implementation of correctional rehabilitation programs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In a prospective design, spanning 21 years, the authors analyzed complete data on offending, marriage, parenthood, and a large set of background information. Random effects were used to model the relation between family-life events and offending, controlling for possible confounders. Findings for men support the hypothesis that marriage promotes desistance from serious offending. Males additionally benefit from parenthood, and from having a first child in particu-lar. Furthermore, although parenthood reduces offending more strongly than marriage, the " full family package " brings the most benefit. Female offending patterns were not significantly influenced by marital status or motherhood. Article},
